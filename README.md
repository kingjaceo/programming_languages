# Welcome to Programming Languages, Spring 2026!

Syllabus

Course Format:
* 2 days a week: lessons and practice
* every Friday: language progress presentations

After we build our first language together, you will arrange yourselves into several different language groups.

Every week, you will:
1) Make meaningful progress on the implementation of your language
2) Brainstorm, discuss, and plan the next developments for your language
3) Present these findings via a brief lecture and demo
4) Decide if you want to stay with your group or change groups
