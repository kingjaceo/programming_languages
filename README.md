# Welcome to Programming Languages, Spring 2026!

Syllabus

Course Format:
* 2 days a week: lessons and practice
* every Friday: language progress presentations

After we build our first language together, you will arrange yourselves into several different language groups.

Every week, you will:
1) Make meaningful progress on the implementation of your language
2) Brainstorm, discuss, and plan the next developments for your language
3) Present these findings via a brief lecture and demo
4) Decide if you want to stay with your group or change groups

In the first week you need to:
* name your language! it can be plain or intricate, simple or silly. who cares! my favorite language is called "Python" and the language in this class is called "Racket"--those are weird names!
* design the syntax, specifically a few example programs with intended output
* implement the very first, most-basic features

Languages:
1) `fractal`
draw different types of fractals, including IFS and L-system fractals, different colors and shapes, etc

2) `waveform`
produce synthetic music using different sounds waves

3) `game-jammer`
produce  simple, easy, clear games with minimal scripting

4) `graphics-editor`
draw graphics on the screen with a combination of scripts and "hand-drawn" textures

5) `algebra`
simplify and solve algebraic expressions

6) `graphs`
draw graphs and run/solve graph algorithms
